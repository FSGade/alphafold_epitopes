# PREDICTION OF EPITOPES USING ALPHAFOLD2 STRUCTURES AND GRAPH NEURAL NETWORKS

> Epitopes are surface-exposed regions of a pathogenic molecule or antigen, which are targeted by the adaptive immune system by e.g. B-cell receptors. Binding is largely determined by the surface features of the target molecule. AlphaFold2 is a deep-learning protein folding model achieving near experimental quality prediction for many proteins. Furthermore, graph-based neural networks such as ProteinSolver allow structural representation of proteins suitable for tasks such as epitope prediction. We investigate improved epitope prediction using Alphafold2 modelled structures over sequence-only models.

The main notebook of this project `Epitope_Prediction.ipynb`, contains demonstrations of our three models (FFNN, RNN & GNN) and two reference models (Discotope2 [[1]](#1) and BepiPred3 [[2]](#2)) and a comparison of their performance. We allow use of both solved structure embeddings and AlphaFold2 [[3]](#2) structure embeddings. Both of these embeddings are made with ProteinSolver [[4]](#2).

Running this notebook requires specific versions of PyTorch and associated packages to be compatible with ProteinSolver. Using anaconda, the following commands should suffice to setup the correct environment:
```
conda env create -f PS_gpu.yaml
conda activate PS_gpu
conda install nb_conda
```
*Note that installing* `nb_conda` *makes it possible to use the conda environment in jupyter*
